== What is Monitoring

TIP: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monitor[monitor] (verb) "to watch, observe, listen to or check (something) for a *special purpose* over a period of time"

* Is it [app, server, ...] working?
* Automate the boring parts of your jobs away
* Is it possible to catch __ ahead of time?
* Business Buzzwords
** "machine data"
** "operational intelligence"

TIP: MIP (Monitoring Implementation Plan)

* Where to start: "Get centralized logging."
** Pay attention to where _your_ constraints tend to be
** Only alert on actionable items (to prevent alert fatigue)


== Developer Perspective

* Look for expected events (or their absense)
* Exploring for unexpected events
* Analyze "shapes" of events
** grouping vs even distribution
** frequent vs rare
** Correlations with other events
* Sanity check external metrics & analytics
* Prioritize code effort
** How is code behaving?
** How is code performing?

== Tools in use

* Unix text tools
** ie `grep`, `sed`, `awk`
** very capable, but require understanding, effort
** better at single files, instances
* *AppDynamics*
** "monitoring by instrumented java"
** Business Transactions
** Aggregate Thresholds
** Excels at application boundaries (host & JVM metrics, remote calls)
** Automatic Timing (of remote calls)
** Deeper inspection of sampled calls (randomly or triggered by condition)
** `-javaagent:.../javaagent.jar` -> hosted AppDynamics server
** warning: Adobe Flash interface
* *Splunk*
** "unified log scraping" (my words)
** any log file, any platform
** fowarder(s) -> indexer(s) -> search head
** TWC has licenses & multiple instances

== Basic Splunk: Topology

forwarder -> indexer -> search head

* *forwarder* streams (log) files to (central) indexers
* *indexer* indexes data for optimized searching, especially over time
** (I/O intensive)
** manage permissions based on index
** generally striped not mirrored
* *search head* Provides UI
** Runs queries against indexers.
** Data manipulations happen at search time (leaving indexed events alone)
* Anticipate multiple forwarders & indexers; Can have separate search heads.
* *License Server* authorizes indexers, search heads
* Can run locally! http://www.splunk.com/download[Splunk Downloads]

== Basic Splunk Concepts

* processing: index-time vs search-time (translate events only as needed)
* events: single entry of data
* fields: name/value pairs extracted from event data
* tags: aliases to field values
* eventtypes
* reports/dashboards
* apps
* permissions/users/roles
* transactions: group related events together for easier analysis


== Basic Splunk: Interface

image::Splunk-UI.png[Splunk Interface]

* Search Box: the query
* Time Selector: time period to execute over (all time; last 2 weeks/1 week/day/hour/15 minutes; real-time windows)
* Events: events matching the query; often truncated but expandable.  Matched fields are highlighted
* Query Controls: manage slow queries, save queries/results, create alerts/dashboards/etc
* Field locator: interact with extracted fields from events (defined per log)

== Splunk Search: fields


A query can be as simple as a word or ID to search for.
However, to help efficiency and find events pertinent to your application:

*Application Fields*

* `index=` specify the indexer queried (else hits all indexers - not polite)
* `sourceType=` alias for a type of log file
* `host=`   which machine the event belonged to
* `source=` path to the log file

(Specifying 1+ of these fields will help efficiency, accuracy)

*Arbitrary Fields*

Admins define other fields per type of log file

* highly structured logs (such as access logs with timestamps, IP, URL, ...)
* unstructured logs (such as Java error logs) have less fields


== Splunk Queries: Transforming Data

Search terms have implicit `AND` between them.
User can change the join logic (such as `OR` and grouping terms.)
Terms can include quoted literal terms `"this is my error"`

Search commands can be piped together, especially for transformations.

* calculations:  `eval velocity=distance/time`
* RegEx extraction:  `rex field=_raw "From: (?<from>.*) To: (?<to>.*)"`
* substitutions:  `lookup usertogroup user output group`
* formatted data extraction:
** XML Key-Value: `xmlkv` extracts keys as new fields
** Structured Path: `spath [output=newField] path=commits.author.name`
** XPath: `xpath outfield=name "//bar/@name"`
* other text-based extractions (`split`, `substr`, ...)
* stats functions (`count`, `avg`, `median`, `max`/`min`, ...)

NOTE: while typing in a search, the UI will attempt to display relavant hints

== Splunk Visualizations: Tables

Sometimes you want summary data instead of the raw events or fields.

*Tables*

* http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/SearchReference/Table[table]
** `index=webcms_cq sourcetype=webcms_pub_error Exception | rex "(?<exc>\S+Exception):" | table exc host source`
** search for Exception, extract exception name into "exc", return a table of 3 columns
* http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/SearchReference/Top[top]
** `index=webcms_cq sourcetype=webcms_pub_error Exception | rex "(?<exc>\S+Exception):" | top exc [by host]`
** Extract Exception names and show counts, percents by default (possible to hide the extra columns)
** the `by host` inserts field "host" for finer-grained data


== Splunk Visualizations: Charts

http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/Viz/Visualizationreference[*Charting* Visualizations]

* Bar charts, column (and stacked)
* line charts (& stacked)
* pie charts
* scatter
* single values
* guages (radial, filler, marker)
* maps (typically from `geostats` command)
* reference commands
** http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/SearchReference/Chart[chart]
** http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/SearchReference/Timechart[timechart]


== Optimizing Searches

(Based on Splunk's http://www.splunk.com/web_assets/pdfs/secure/Splunk_Quick_Reference_Guide.pdf[Quick Reference Guide])

* make searches as specific as possible (eg `fatal_error`, not `\*error*`)
* limit time range (eg `-1h` instead of `-1w`)
* filter out unneeded fields asap
* filter out results before calculations
* prefer "Advanced Charting" view over "Flashtimeline" (which calculates timelines)
* in Flashtimeline, turn off "Discover Fields" when not needed
* use summary indexes to pre-calculate commonly used values
* make disk I/O the fastest available


== Advanced Splunk: Alerts


image::Splunk-alertFromSearch.png[create alert from search]
image::Splunk-alertDetails.png[alert details from manager, role="right"]

Alert from Manager (Searches & Reports.Manage Searches & Reports, filter & select alert):


* search, time range
* description
* schedule (cron vs basic: every week, day, _n_ hours, _m_ minutes)
* Condition: (always, \# events, \# hosts, \# sources, custom condition)
* Alert mode: (per search vs per result)
* Throttling, Expiration, Severity
* Actions: email (subject, comma-separated addresses)
* Results: in email (inline, CSV, PDF)
* RSS feed
* trigger script
* ...



== Advanced Splunk: Dashboards

(if permissions) Dashboards & Views.{dashboard name}, Edit:on

* panels
** search with optional visualization/charting
** edit search:
**** search string or saved search
**** time range
** edit visualization
** delete panel
** _can be stacked horizontally, but changes to vertical stack in PDFs_
* edit XML (handy for editing dashboard as a whole or "dumping" the dashboard)
* edit permissions

TIP: if dashboard is scheduled (ie email distribution), then ensure each search completes in less than a minute.


== Splunk in Practice: Real-time traffic

== Splunk in Practice: Top CQ5 Exceptions

* http://redacted.test/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?s=%2FservicesNS%2Fnobody%2Fsearch%2Fsaved%2Fsearches%2FCQ5%2520Top%2520Publish%2520Exceptions[CQ5 Top Publish Exceptions]
** Exploration query: what is happening
** Can focus on most frequent exceptions
** or focus on rare, but "shouldn't happen" ones
** Killed exception #1: `IllegalStateException: page needs a session` (was up to 85% of old exceptions)

== Splunk in Practice: live demo

=== narrow down time-range:
`index=webcms_apache sourcetype=webcms_apache_access GET | timechart median(Microseconds)`

=== Conclusion:

Recently, we have put a focus on understanding sporadic sluggish responses.
We know some requests still respond quickly, but the worst-case rapidly gets worse.
Our latest theory is either bulk activation/replication or dispatcher flushes (more pages than needed).
